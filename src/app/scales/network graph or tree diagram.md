However, based on your description of "connected tree dot" visualization, it sounds like you might be referring to a type of network graph or tree diagram. Here are a few possibilities that match that general description:

1. Force-directed graph: A visualization where nodes (dots) are connected by lines or edges, often used to show relationships or connections between entities.
2. Node-link diagram: Similar to a force-directed graph, but potentially with a more hierarchical structure.
3. Dendogram: A tree-like diagram used to illustrate hierarchical clustering.
4. Network diagram: A general term for visualizations that show interconnected nodes.
5. Concept map: A diagram showing relationships between concepts, often represented as labeled nodes connected by lines.

Without seeing the specific visualization, it's difficult to determine exactly which type it is. If you could provide more details about the appearance or functionality of the visualization, I could offer a more precise identification or explanation of the visualization technique used.
